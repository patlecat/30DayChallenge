# 30 Day Challenge Webservice

This tool was created as a challenge in at a Hackergarten event in ZÃ¼rich in February of 2025. The challenge that I (Patrick Scheller) created was to create a complete, albeit small, webservice in 1 evening using a nocode AI service.

## Goals
Features I wanted to implement are listed here. They were more guidelines to understand what the tool should do then hard requirements. We tried what we could and some features were easier and faster to implement than others and not because of technical difficulties with the features.


## Tools Used
* Tempo Labs AI
	* ReactJs
	* Vite
* Supabase

## Conclusions
It was ambitious to achieve and I wondered how it will be to work as a team on this together.

## Participants & Thanks
These guys worked very hard with me to get this done. Thanks a lot to their enthusiasm and to [Quatico](https://www.quatico.com/) (hoster of the Hackergarten) and [TempoLabs](https://www.tempo.new/) for their support.
